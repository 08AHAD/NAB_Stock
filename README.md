# NAB_Stock
This project visualizes the historical price data of NAB.AX (National Australia Bank) using Python, with a focus on creating an interactive and informative chart. The project utilizes data fetched from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library and leverages the powerful plotting capabilities of Plotly to generate a candlestick chart with additional overlays for the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The project also includes a volume bar chart to provide insights into trading activity over time.

Key Features:
OHLC Candlestick Chart: Displays open, high, low, and close prices for each trading day.
Moving Averages: Includes 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) to highlight trends and potential support/resistance levels.
Volume Analysis: Provides a bar chart of daily trading volume, helping to visualize the intensity of market activity.
Interactive Visualization: The charts are interactive, allowing users to zoom in, hover for details, and explore specific time periods.
Application in Data Science
This project serves as a foundational example of financial data analysis and visualization, which is a crucial aspect of data science in the finance industry. Key applications include:

Technical Analysis: Moving averages and candlestick charts are essential tools for technical analysts to identify trends, potential breakouts, and reversals in stock prices.
Market Research: The ability to visualize historical price data allows data scientists and analysts to backtest trading strategies and perform time series analysis.
Quantitative Finance: By incorporating additional financial indicators and statistical methods, this project can be extended into more complex models for predicting stock prices, volatility, and risk management.
Portfolio Management: Historical price and volume analysis assists in making informed decisions about asset allocation and timing for buying or selling assets.
